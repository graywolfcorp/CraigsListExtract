CraigsListExtract.exe (the app) is designed to automate searching across one or more sites within the CraigsList domain.

The app is pre-configured to search for firewood at the fairbanks CL site. 

The app requires several text files to exist in the app directory and to be configured for the sites and urls to extract.

Core files:

CraigsListExtract.txt - this contains all the CL sites to visit.  A list of all current CL sites can be generated by using the -sites switch ie. CraigsListExtract.exe -sites. Simply copy the domains you want to search from the sites file to CraigsListExtract.txt.

UrlsToExtract.txt - this contains the query to run at each CL site.  Urls should be generated by visitng a CL site and copying the query string from the url after running a query. 

A valid string will look similar to this: /search/jjj?query=c%23&zoomToPosting=&srchType=A&addOne=telecommuting

UrlsToExtract also defines the number of days back to consider a posting valid and also sets the output file for any matching posts.

A valid line will look something like this:

-s /search/jjj?query=c%23&zoomToPosting=&srchType=A&addOne=telecommuting -f C:\Projects\Graywolf\CraigsListExtract\Files\extract.html -d 30

-s - the CL search params
-f - matching posts export file
-d - number of prior days to include (from today)

Lines can be excluded using the standard dos REM command:

REM -s /search/jjj?query=c%23&zoomToPosting=&srchType=A&addOne=telecommuting -f C:\Projects\Graywolf\CraigsListExtract\Files\extract.html -d 30

Optional files:

PhrasesToExclude.txt - this will exclude any posting that contains any of the words in the file. Enter words one per line.

UrlsToExclude.txt - will exclude any posting where the url matches any url found in this file.

Once all the files are configured, simply run CraigsListExtract.exe with no switches and the extract should begin.
